      <section id="cognitive-control">
        <h2>Cognitive Control Architectures</h2>
        <p>Cognitive control refers to the brain’s ability to manage competing information streams, stay focused on goals and switch tasks when necessary. In neurodivergent populations, the architecture of these control systems can differ substantially from neurotypical patterns.</p>
        <p>Current projects explore how individuals with autism and ADHD deploy attention and inhibition, and how adaptive strategies can be designed to support strengths while mitigating challenges. By modelling executive function as a network of interacting modules, we aim to identify leverage points for personalised interventions.</p>

      <!-- Information Bottleneck section -->
      <section id="information-bottleneck">
        <h2>Information Bottleneck Theory</h2>
        <p>The information bottleneck framework provides tools for understanding trade‑offs between accuracy and complexity. In biological systems, the brain must compress vast streams of sensory data into actionable representations while preserving behaviourally relevant information.</p>
        <p>Graeme’s research applies the information bottleneck principle to memory and learning. How does the brain decide which details to keep and which to discard? How do bottlenecks influence creativity and problem solving? Insights from these models inform both cognitive theory and machine learning architectures.</p>

      <!-- Network Neuroscience section -->
      <section id="network-neuroscience">
        <h2>Network Neuroscience Frameworks</h2>
        <p>Brains are networks of networks. Beyond individual regions, cognition emerges from dynamic interactions across distributed circuits. Network neuroscience uses graph theory and dynamical systems to map these interactions and uncover patterns underlying perception, language and decision‑making.</p>
        <p>Ongoing work builds network models that integrate structural connectivity (the anatomical wiring) with functional connectivity (the synchronisation of neural activity) to understand how specialised tasks are routed through the brain. Particular interest lies in identifying motifs associated with divergent thinking and hyperspecialisation.</p>

      <!-- Future Directions -->
      <section id="future-directions">
        <h2>Future Directions</h2>
        <p>The intersection of cognitive control, information theory and network neuroscience is rich with unanswered questions. Future projects will explore how hormonal changes (e.g. menopause) interact with neurodivergence, how co‑dependency dynamics affect cognitive resilience, and how AI can augment human insight in these domains.</p>
